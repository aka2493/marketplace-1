            Jasper AI is an AI-powered virtual assistant developed by Cisco. It
            is designed to provide businesses with a conversational AI interface
            that can help customers with common queries and tasks. Jasper AI is
            built on Cisco's Conversational AI platform, which uses natural
            language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to
            understand and respond to user queries. Jasper AI can be integrated
            into a variety of channels, such as chatbots, voice assistants, and
            messaging platforms. It can be used to automate tasks such as
            customer service inquiries, appointment scheduling, and order
            tracking. Additionally, Jasper AI can provide personalized
            recommendations to customers based on their previous interactions
            and behavior.
